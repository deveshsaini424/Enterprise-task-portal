Steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone 
cd 


Backend Setup:

# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /backend folder with the following:
PORT=8080
DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_random_secret_key_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
# FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 (Update later after frontend deployment)

# Start the backend server
npm start 
# (Ensure package.json has "start": "nodemon index.js" or "node index.js")


Frontend Setup:

# Open a NEW terminal window/tab
# Navigate to the frontend folder FROM THE ROOT directory
cd ../frontend 
# Or directly: cd path/to/your-repo/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /frontend folder with the following:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 
# (This should match the backend PORT)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev


Your application should now be running locally! Frontend at http://localhost:5173, Backend at http://localhost:8080.
